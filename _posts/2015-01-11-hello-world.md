title: Hello, World!

I set up this blog using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which converts markdown files into blog posts. Writing in markdown (or R markdown) is super easy, though it can be customized. The layout I am using is a slightly modified version of Hyde, created by [Poole](http://getpoole.com/). Poole gets you set up with Jekyll and provides you with a few nice, clean layout choices. 

Anyway, I imagine that posts will be on a wide variety of topics, including public opinion in non-democracies and football.
