title: Shiny App
---

I have a working web app made with R's `shiny` package. Check it out [here](http://jchaskell.shinyapps.io/app2). I had been playing with cross-national survey data on trust in non-democracies, printing out a dozen graphs, and I realized it would be much easier if I could switch between graphs with a quick click of the mouse. `Shiny` let's you do that and many other cool things~

The app uses a drop down menu that allows you to choose the country you want to see data for. If you're interested in seeing the R code, the markdown file is [here](https://github.com/jchaskell/trust.app/blob/master/app2/trust.app.Rmd). It would be particularly useful if you're trying to create an app where you need to subset the data depending on the user's choice. It took me some time and trial and error to figure out how to implement that feature.
