I had dreams of writing more on this website at multiple points in the past. Most recently, I planned to write more after graduating last fall, but I also was busy starting a new job at the same time which took priority. Now that I have settled in to that job more, I hope to post more often. The posts will take one of two forms: 

1. A post about a short analysis or project that I have done using R (or other tools like python or bash). I have some things that I can share from past coding projects and some ideas for how to use data from past projects to do other types of analysis. Maybe I will also try to build some tools that are generally useful.

2. I will also try to post a weekly “Friday Links” summary of what I have been reading, listening to, watching recently. I have tried to do a better job of reading longer form articles instead of only scrolling through Twitter and Facebook posts, and it would be nice to have a platform for sharing.

For the curious, I made this site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and use the [Hyde theme](http://hyde.getpoole.com/), at least for now. However, I write in RMarkdown, even when I am not including R code, and use the `servr` [package](https://jekyll.yihui.name/2014/09/jekyll-with-knitr.html) to create the posts.
