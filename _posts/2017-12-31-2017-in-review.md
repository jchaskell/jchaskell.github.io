* At this time last year, I had just started a new job and still felt uncomfortable with the new environment and new set of technologies. Over the course of the year, I learned a lot (and realized that, especially at a start-up, everyone is still trying to figure things out). I also grew to appreciate how awesome the team I work with is. Next year, I am looking forward to working on a new project. 

* Specifically, I learned some things about modern [distributed computing](https://spark.apache.org/), which let me write a lot of Spark code that continues to save my company time and money.

* I participated in a [protest](https://www.instagram.com/p/BPjbhJwAmRg8cqBCf6ydktELfJaMX8C54kZkm80/?taken-by=jchaskell2) and called my representatives, both of which were new experiences for me.

* Zi and I went to Malaysia for a wedding and to see family, and we added on a trip to Cambodia. Angkor Wat is really beautiful, and most of it is not as crowded as the main temple.

* I read 15 books this year, which is a pretty big accomplishment for me. I did not read for fun much during graduate school. See below for the books I enjoyed the most.

* I improved my baking skills. I made a few types of bread, pie, and a chocolate babka that received rave reviews.

## Recommendations
### Reading 

* My favorite book of 2017 was [*Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693910-barbarian-days), by William Finnegan. It is a well-written memoir about a lot more than surfing.

* I also liked [*Ghost Wars*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71984.Ghost_Wars), by Steven Coll, which covers the CIA's long history in Afghanistan (yes, it's long), and Haruki Murakami's memoir [*What I Talk ABout When I Talk About Running*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2195464.What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running).

* Evan Osnos wrote a great, [long piece](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/18/the-risk-of-nuclear-war-with-north-korea) in the *New Yorker* about the risk of nuclear war with North Korea, after he took a reporting trip there.

* ProPublica, which does a lot of great journalism, did a series on maternal mortality. I have not read their most recent installment yet, but the piece before that digs into [why black women die in childbirth](https://www.propublica.org/article/nothing-protects-black-women-from-dying-in-pregnancy-and-childbirth) at much higher rates than white women.

### Watching/Listening

* My favorite movie of the year, by far, was *Star Wars: The Last Jedi*. In fact, it may have been my favorite Star Wars movie period (heresy, I know).  

* We really enjoyed watching *The Great British Bake-Off* (available on PBS and Netflix). The characters are lovely, and there is a lot less manufactured drama than in American cooking shows. It definitely inspired me to bake more.

* I love listening to podcasts, about anything from politics and policy to football and cooking. My favorite general purpose show is [*The Ezra Klein Show*](https://www.vox.com/ezra-klein-show-podcast), which features interviews of people from all walks of public life. My favorite individual show was *Recode Decode*'s [episode with Sheryl Sandberg](https://soundcloud.com/recode-decode/sheryl-sandberg-on-setbacks) that focused on grief.
