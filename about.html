<p>Hi! I am currently a Phd candidate in political science at Stanford. My dissertation research examines political rhetoric about China in the United States, how it has evolved over time, and what drives anti-China speech and attitudes. Since I enjoy playing with all types of data and creating data visualizations , I created this site to share some of what I have done, related to my research and otherwise.</p>

<p>I have also worked as a data scientist at Nielsen, working on audience measurment  on mobile. In the past, I worked in China as an academic researcher, an editor for the China Elections and Governance website, and an English instructor. I still have a deep appreciation for <a href="jchaskell.github.io/sichuan_noodles.jpg">legit Sichuan food</a> and <a href="http://www.farwestchina.com/2008/08/xinjiangs-best-food-da-pan-ji.html"><i>da pan ji</i></a>.</p>
