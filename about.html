<p>Hi! I work in data science at <a href="https://www.nuna.com/">Nuna Inc</a>, a healthcare company that does data analytics and warehousing. I come to data science from a somewhat unusual background, as I studied political science and wrote a dissertation on American political rhetoric about China. I have also studied Chinese domestic politics and spent two years working (and eating) in Beijing.</p>

<p>This site will likely have little to do with my day job or past research but instead be the results of playing with various types of data.</p>
